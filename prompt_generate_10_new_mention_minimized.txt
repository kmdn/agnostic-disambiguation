Revised Prompt for Generating Multiple New Mentions & Entities
Task:

Given an input text with entity mentions, generate 10 distinct modified versions of the text, each with:

    New mentions replacing the original mentions.

    Valid Wikipedia IDs for each new mention.

    Semantic coherence (new mentions fit the context and work together logically).

Input:

    A text snippet with entity mentions.

    A list of mentions to replace (with Wikipedia IDs if available).

Output:

A JSON list of 10 alternatives, each adhering to the original structure. Each alternative must:

    Replace all original mentions with new ones.

    Include unique combinations of mentions/entities across alternatives.
	
Output Requirements:

    Placeholder-ized Text: Replace each mention in input_text with {0}, {1}, etc., in order of occurrence.

    Replacements: For each alternative, provide:

        entities: Array of {new: "Replacement", wiki: "Wikipedia_ID"} (aligned with mentions order).

    Constraints:

        All new mentions must fit the original context.

        All wiki IDs must exist on Wikipedia.

        Handle duplicate mentions.

Output Format (JSON):
json

{
  "input_text": "Text with {0}, {1} and so on.", 
  "mentions": ["Mention1", "Mention2", ...],
  "replacements": [
    {
      "entities": [
        {"new": "Replacement1", "wiki": "Wiki_ID1"},
        {"new": "Replacement2", "wiki": "Wiki_ID2"}
		// as many as there are mentions
      ]
    }
    // ... N-1 more alternatives
  ]
}

Additional Guidelines:

    Diversity: Ensure the 10 alternatives cover meaningfully different entities (e.g., different cities, agencies, brands or similar).

    Naturalness: New mentions should sound natural, plausible and coherent in the text.

    Wikipedia Validation: All wikipedia_id fields must link to existing pages.

    Consistency: Within each alternative, new mentions should not contradict each other (e.g., "FBI" and "Tokyo" is fine; "FBI" and "Medieval Knights" is not).

Example Input:
text

Original Text: "Samsung released a new phone in Seoul."  
Mentions: ["Samsung", "Seoul"]  
Wikipedia IDs: ["Samsung", "Seoul"]  

Example Output:
json

{
  "modified_text": "{0} launched a new smartphone in {1}.",
  "mentions": ["Samsung", "Seoul"],
  "replacements": [
    {
      "entities": [
        {"new": "Apple", "wiki": "Apple_Inc."},
        {"new": "Cupertino", "wiki": "Cupertino,_California"},
      ]
    },
    {
      "entities": [
        {"new": "Nokia", "wiki": "Nokia"},
        {"new": "Helsinki", "wiki": "Helsinki"},
      ]
    },
    // ... more alternatives
  ]
}
